<p>This paper studies a many-to-one matching model, and shows that the set of envy-free matchings is a lattice. A Tarski operator on this lattice that can be interpreted 
as modeling vacancy chains, has the set of stable matchings as its fixed points. </p>

<p> Repugnant transactions are sometimes banned, but legal bans sometimes give rise to active black markets that are difficult if not impossible to extinguish. We explore a model in which the probability of extinguishing 
a black market depends on the extent to which its transactions are regarded as repugnant, as measured by the proportion of the population that disapproves of them, and the intensity of that repugnance, as measured by willingness 
to punish. Sufficiently repugnant markets can be extinguished with even mild punishments, while others are insufficiently repugnant for this, and become exponentially more difficult to extinguish the larger they become.  </p>

<p>This paper reveals a characteristic of stable matchings in the college admissions problem and provides structural insights and a unified treatment for several results in this model, including the famous "Rural Hospital Theorem". 
We also show that the worst student determines the whole entering class. </p>

<h2>Work in Progress</h2>
  
<div style="width:1600px;">
<ul>
<li> <p> Competition between Streaming Platforms </p>
 
<p> This paper studies the matching between streamers and streaming platforms. The market is decentralized and has two features: first, platforms use a simple linear payment structure; second, there are externalities between streamers. 
We show that under a substitutability condition together with certain restriction on platform side externalities, a stable matching always exists. Furthermore, any job-hopping process such that streamers switch platforms seeking better 
terms eventually stabilizes, leaving stable matchings as the likely steady states of the market. We then study the game in which platforms select their payment rules and show that in a small market, although a Nash equilibrium always 
exists, there may not be a pure one. Finally we justify the payment scheme of platforms through a large market model in which platforms signing linear non-discriminatory contracts with streamers is an equilibrium outcome.   </p>

<li> <p>Dynamic Matching with Teams </p>

<p>This paper studies a dynamic matching model in which a social planner creates team based game sessions for sequentially arriving players and seeks a balance between team skills, player role preferences and waiting times. When there 
is no role selection, we derive a closed-form optimal matching policy and show that as the team size grows and the market becomes more balanced, greedy policies become less appealing. In the general model, we formulate the problem as a 
Markov decision process and show that the optimal decision boundary is linear.  </p>
</ul>

<h2>Other Writings</h2>
  
<br>
<h3>Combinatorial Game Theory</h3>
<ul>
<li> <a href="research/Honor Thesis.pdf">Undergraduate Mathematics Honor Thesis: Mathematics Behind Go Endgames (2014):</a>
  
<p>This was my undergraduate honor thesis, advised by Dr Florian Block. Just like most other undergrad math theses, it is mostly expository. The goal of the thesis is to study Go, a popular board game in East Asia, with the tools in 
combinatorial game theory. The main references are Berlekamp and Wolfe's "Mathematical Go" and Berlekamp, Conway and Guy's "Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays". I tried to give a systematic review on this topic and provided some
extra examples.  </p>  

<li> <a href="research/Math 191Domineering.pdf">A Study of 2Xn and 3Xn Domineering (2010):</a>
  
<p> My math 191 project with Michael Landry, advised by Dr Daniel Cristofaro-Gardiner. We solved 2xn (except 2x31) and 3xn Domineering games by pure combinatorial arguments. The problem was solved in the 1980s, probably first by 
Berlekamp. But I think he used advanced knowledge such as temperature theory, while we only used simple primitive arguments (a little bit tedious of course). So just take it as some solution notes.</p>  

<li> <a href="research/Math 191- Chess.pdf">A Combinatorial Game Theoretic Analysis of Chess Endgames (2010):</a>
  
<p> Another math 191 project with Michael Landry and Frank Yu, again advised by Dr Daniel Cristofaro-Gardiner. It is a note on how to do basic analysis on chess endgames with combinatorial game theory.</p>  
</ul>

<h3>Publications in Chinese</h3>
<ul>
    <li> <a href="research/local inequality.pdf">Constructing Local Inequalities Using Function Concavity (2009), Bulletin of Mathematics, 10, 30-31:</a>
  
<p>My first ever "paper" published in China, back to the days when I was a high school student. It introduces a method of constructing local inequalities based on function concavity. The method itself was not created by me, but it was 
unkown to many fellow high school math Olympiads participants. Very often people are amazed by the well-crafted local inequalities and wonder how smart the solution writters are. So I decided to write an article about it in order to 
spread the knowledge.  </p>  

    <li> <a href="research/An Important Characteristic of Equilateral Triangles.pdf">An Important Characteristic of Equilateral Triangles (2009), Company in Mathematics, 20, 59-60:</a>
 
<p>Another article I wrote when I was in high school. It describes a characteristic of equilateral triangles in the form of complex numbers. When applied properly, it can solve hard geometry problems with ease. I was in a hurry to 
publish this article for my college application, so it was published by a mediocre high school education journal. One year later, it was accepted by another national level journal, which is too late. However I do think this one is
better written than the previous one.  </p>
